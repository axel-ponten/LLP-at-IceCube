Since we saw L2 filtering having some randomness in it we are making sure that processing from trigger to level 2 works like it should.

Use standard IceCube environment and scripts directly from icetray src folder for this.

Conclusion: when removing events that ONLY pass minbias filter, we don't get the randomness anymore.
